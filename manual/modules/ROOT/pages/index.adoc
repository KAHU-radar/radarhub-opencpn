== Summary

image::screenshot.png[Screenshot of full UI]

Contribute AIS and ARPA targets from your vessel to crowdsourcing for
marine safety!

This plugin lets you upload AIS and radar ARPA targets (or any NMEA) to
an internet server. Upload can be continuous, over intermittent
internet, or scheduled, and tracks can be downsampled to fit your
bandwidth. The communication protocol is based on
https://avro.apache.org/[Apache Avro] and batches track points so that
the overhead for each point above timestamp and lat/lon is low, meaning
it is designed to be as bandwidth conservative as possible.


== Server

An example server written in Python is provided in the
https://github.com/KAHU-radar/radarhub_pi/tree/master/server[`the
server subdirectory of the plugin sources`]. This server implements
the full protocol, but just dumps all received tracks to disk in
geojson format. It can be used as a simple shore based VDR, but mostly
serves as an example base for anyone wanting to build a more elaborate
server side setup.


== Integration with other plugins

This plugin is designed to be used in conjunction with the
https://github.com/opencpn-radar-pi/radar_pi[radar_pi] radar plugin.
Make sure to enable ARPA targets, as that is what this plugin uses.
Alternatively, it can use
https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_ttm_tracked_target_message[`$RATTM`]
and
https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_tll_target_latitude_and_longitude[`$RATTL`]
NMEA messages originating from an external radar system.


== Settings

Options > Plugins > KAHU radar hub > Preferences

The settings window is also the only user interface provided by the
plugin. During normal operations, the plugin is only working in the
background, sending tracks.

=== Server account

To use the plugin, you need an API key for an account on a server /
crowdsourcing platform, as well as servername and port. Start by
making an account with the http://radarhub.kahu.earth[`KAHU radar
hub`]. Once signed in, create an API key for your boat and fill it in
in the plugin preferences. Hit `save`.

Once you open the plugin preferences again, the connection status
(shown under the last connection time) should say "logged in".

=== Internet connectivity

The plugin will connect to the server over TCP, and will reconnect of
the connection is terminated. It will use exponential back-off to not
saturate a bad connection with reconnection attempts. The shortest and
longest reconnection times for this back-off algorithm can be
specified in the `Minimum reconnect delay` and `Maximum reconnect
delay` fields respectively.

=== Connection status

The preferences dialog shows when the plugin managed to connect to the
server last (time and date), and right under that, the connection
status - connected, logged in, or an error.

The dialog also shows how many received tracks (that is, individual
ARPA targets from your radar) are waiting to be sent, as well as the
total number of unsent trackpoints.

== Track cache

Tracks are stored in `~/.opencpn/routecache.sqlite3` (and the
corresponding path on windows). If this file is deleted, all sent and
unsent tracks are deleted. The file will be created as soon as the
plugin runs.

Note: The size of the data in this file is larger than what is
transferred over the network - both due to metadata needed for
bookkeeeping, due to downsampling of tracks, not sending all details
of messages and due to a less compressed format.
